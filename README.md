# ncmobley.github.io

1. Nathaniel Mobley/ncmobley@my.waketech.edu
2. My GitHub account is public and has only one repository named ncmobley.github.io. When going to my page, the only things listed are when I joined the site on February 18th and the creation of my first repository which was on the same date. I do not have any current projects, packages, or stars. 
3. The repository I made is a folder in which I will be hosting my work for the rest of the semester. This folder will be hosted online and via my desktop. I can make changes to it via the Mac desktop app. 
4. On my Macbook, it was very simple to clone the repository. I installed the GitHub desktop app, and then once it had been installed, I logged into the app and let it finish italicizing. Once this was complete, the program was then moved to my applications folder and restarted. Upon restarting, I was logged into the program, and on the right side, it had a giant button that said clone repository. I clicked this button selected the right one, and then hit confirm, and the file was cloned into my documents folder.
